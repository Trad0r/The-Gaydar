print(random_line('whatever.txt'))
use this for all the loading text.
replace the word "whatever" with the name of the file.
i implmented this at like 3 am so it might not work

lines 229 - 442 absoultely suck, we really need to clean that up somehow
maybe we could put everything into a varible and just paste it into every thing
i've updated it so it now uses 'or', clearing two of the big blocks of spaghetti
because of this empty space, i've added a special statement that happens when you get a score above 50 but
still not 100.

i find a way to get lines 17 - 19 to work so i can block user input until needed
