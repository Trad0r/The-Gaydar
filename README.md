Hey guys!

In 1.0.1 I have accomplished something huge.
GAYDAR now dumps results to a file named pain.log, allowing you to check if you've already scanned a person without needing to sit through the scanning process again!
Thanks for waiting for so long, I'm dumb so it took awhile to implement something that's this simple.
Next update, I plan on moving the gender input to the beginning, cleaning up the spaghetti, and adding a continue function so you can scan more people without reruning the program.

Old README:
A little coded thingy I made while bored in class to make fun of my friends. And now you can too!

With the GAYDAR, bullying has become way easier.

With 2 ways to rig it so it's either really not or REALLY not in your target's favor, you'll get the whole gang laughing when it says {name} is 1000% gay!
Here's how to rig it.

Put a space before you input the gender for 1000%

Example: boy

Put a space after you input the gender for 100%

Example:boy 

Whenever you get people laughing at someone, you can thank the GAYDAR!

Also, if you wanna use this garbage, just download main or follow the replit link.
